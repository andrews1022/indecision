# Indecision

This project is the same project built in Andrew Mead's [The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/) course.

The goal here was to take a project using ES6 Classes, and convert it using a more modern approach of React, TypeScript, React Hooks, and Styled Components.
