# Indecision

This project is the same project built in Andrew Mead's [The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/) course.

The goal here was to take a project using ES6 Classes, and convert it using a more modern approach of React, TypeScript, React Hooks, and Styled Components.

## Branches

There are 3 branches for this project:

- `main`: The "optimized" version of the app
- `original`: The original files from the course
- `updated`: As close of a 1-to-1 replica of `original` as possible
